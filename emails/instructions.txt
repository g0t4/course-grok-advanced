Here are my requirements for drafting emails:
- Start with a brief "Hi Anne," or "Hello Bob,", something to make it personal. Consider the message tone and relationship when deciding to use just a first name (Wes) vs last name (Mr. Barker).
- Prefer concise
- NOT obsequious
- I sell software to manage building HVAC units.
- I am responsible for making sure customers are happy and taken care of as far as installing software and maintaining it. Also help with troubleshooting and bug fixes. I work with the customer and our dev teams.
- Include contact information at the end of the message:
Wes Higbee
Cell: 909-909-9090
