I want to send a thank you email to a professional contact I met last week.
His name is Dan Eduardo
He owns a company called Outsourcing Pros
We just installed a new HVAC control system at their headquarters in Washington, D.C.
I will be reaching out with him weekly to review logs and build key system reports.
weekly for the next month
Also, I want to include a brief reminder that we agreed for that to happen on Wednesdays at 2PM. Something like "looking forward toâ€¦"
And he needs my contact info including my work email wes@hvac-software.com
